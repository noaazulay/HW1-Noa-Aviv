### Welcome

Welcome to Assignment 1 in R!

This is the first graded assignment where you actually have to *submit* a solution. So please pay attention:

* You can play with the assignment in Playground mode, but:
* Only your private Github repository assigned to you by the course admin will be cloned and graded (Submission mode, see instructions [here](https://github.com/DSApps-2023/Class_Slides/blob/master/Apps_of_DS_HW.pdf))
* Like any other University assignment, your work should remain private
* You need to `git clone` your private Github repository locally as explained [here](https://github.com/DSApps-2023/Class_Slides/blob/master/Apps_of_DS_HW.pdf)
* You need to uncomment the starter code inside the chunk, replace the `### YOUR CODE HERE ###`, run the chunk and see that you're getting the expected result
* Pay attention to what you're asked to do and the required output
* For example, using a *different* function than the one you were specifically asked to use, will decrease your score (unless you amaze me)
* Your notebook should run smoothly from start to end if someone presses in the RStudio toolbar Run --> Restart R and Run All Chunks
* When you're done knit the entire notebook into a html file, this is the file that would be graded
* You can add other files but do not delete any files
* Commit your work and push to your private Github repository as explained [here](https://github.com/DSApps-2023/Class_Slides/blob/master/Apps_of_DS_HW.pdf)

### The `passwords` Dataset

The dataset we'll explore in this assignment is the `passwords` dataset from [Information is Beautiful](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/top-500-passwords-visualized/) provided by the [Tidy Tuesday repo](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-01-14).

This dataset contains ~500 top passwords ranked by popularity (variable `rank` where 1 is most popular). For each password we also get:

* its `strength` (0 is weakest)
* `category` - one of several categories, e.g. "fluffy"
* `offline_crack_sec` - Time to crack offline in seconds
* `value` - Time to crack by online guessing
* `time_unit` - Time unit to match with `value`

We will not be talking on what's behind a password's `strength` or "time to crack", but you're welcome to start reading about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength).

### Packages

These are the packages you will need. If you don't have them, you need to uncomment the `install.packages()` line and install them first (you can also just copy this command to the R console and do it there if you don't want all the output printed in this notebook).

When you load the packages you may see different kinds of messages or warnings, skim them:

```{r}
# install.packages(c("tidyverse"))
library(tidyverse)
```

### Read In Data

##### (10 points)

Read in the `passwords.csv` located at URL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-01-14/passwords.csv". Use the [`read_csv()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) function from the `readr` package, already loaded if you loaded the `tidyverse` package.

```{r}
# passwords <- ### YOUR CODE HERE ###
```

Take a `glimpse()` at the data:

```{r}
### YOUR CODE HERE ###
```

Print the number of rows and columns (no need to make it "pretty"):

```{r}
### YOUR CODE HERE ###
```

### Basic `dplyr` Verbs

##### (20 points)

Filter only passwords from the "fluffy" category (use only Tidyverse functions!):

```{r}
### YOUR CODE HERE ###
```

Filter only passwords in the "sport" and "cool-macho" and select only the `rank`, `password`, `category` and `strength` columns:

```{r}
### YOUR CODE HERE ###
```

Same as above, but sort by `strength`, from weakest to strongest (and do try to make this in a single pipe):

```{r}
### YOUR CODE HERE ###
```

Create a new column `is_123` which will hold TRUE if the password contains the string "123" and FALSE otherwise. Use the [`mutate()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html) function and have a look at the [`str_detect()`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_detect.html) function from the `stringr` package, already loaded if you loaded the `tidyverse` package.

```{r}
# passwords <- passwords %>%
#   mutate(### YOUR CODE HERE ###)
```

Use the column you created to filter only passwords containing "123", use the [`pull()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pull.html) function to extract those passwords as a vector called `passwords_with_123` and print it:

```{r}
# passwords_with_123 <- passwords %>% ### YOUR CODE HERE ###
#
# print(passwords_with_123)
```

Use the [`summarise()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html) function to get the mean`strength` of passwords in the "food" category:

```{r}
# passwords %>%
#   filter(### YOUR CODE HERE ###) %>%
#   summarise(### YOUR CODE HERE ###)
```

### `group_by`, `summarize` and `count`

##### (20 points)

Group the data by `category`, extract the mean strength in each category and sort by mean strength descending. Be sure to remove `NA` values if necessary:

```{r}
# passwords %>%
#   ### YOUR CODE HERE ### %>%
#   summarise(### YOUR CODE HERE ###) %>%
#   ### YOUR CODE HERE ###
```

Count how many passwords appear in each category. Do not use the `group_by()` function.

```{r}
### YOUR CODE HERE ###
```

Combine the above two outputs in a single pipe: a table with a category's name `category`, `n` the number of passwords in it and `mean_strength`, their mean strength without `NA` values. Now you *may* use `group_by()` and also have a look at [`n()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/n.html):

```{r}
# passwords %>%
#   ### YOUR CODE HERE ### %>%
#   summarise(### YOUR CODE HERE ###)
```

### `distinct`, `case_when` and `rename`

##### (10 points)

Print the `distinct()` (or `unique()`) categories of passwords containing "123":

```{r}
# passwords %>%
#   filter(### YOUR CODE HERE ###) %>%
#   ### YOUR CODE HERE (can be more than 1 line) ###
```

Create a new column `time_unit_seconds` which will hold for each `time_unit` the number of **seconds** it represents (or `NA` if it is `NA`).

For your convenience:

* a minute is 60 seconds
* an hour is 3600 seconds
* a day is 86400 seconds
* a week is 604800 seconds
* a month is 2629746 seconds (with 30.436875 days...)
* a year is 31536000 seconds (with 365 days)

```{r}
# passwords <- passwords %>%
#   mutate(time_unit_seconds = case_when(
#     ### YOUR CODE HERE ###
#     TRUE ~ NA_real_
#   ))
```

Do the same as above (yes, again), but now use the `case_match()` function, and in addition add a new column `value_seconds` which contains the "Time to crack by online guessing **in seconds**", using the `time_unit_seconds` column you have just created. Create the two columns with a single call to `mutate()`:

```{r}
# passwords <- passwords %>%
#   mutate(### YOUR CODE HERE ###)
```

On second thought I don't like the `value_seconds` column name, change it to something more meaningful, like `time_to_crack_sec`:

```{r}
# passwords <- passwords %>%
#   rename(### YOUR CODE HERE ###)
```

### `select_if` and `across`

##### (10 points)

See that the transformation you just made worked by selecting only numeric columns:

```{r}
# passwords %>%
#   select_if(### YOUR CODE HERE ###)
```


Use the `recode_yes_no()` function below to have **all logical columns** contain either "Yes" or "No" instead of TRUE or FALSE (use `across()`!):

```{r}
recode_yes_no <- function(bool) ifelse(bool, "Yes", "No")

# passwords <- passwords %>%
#   mutate(### YOUR CODE HERE ###)
```

For each of the columns `time_to_crack_sec` and `offline_crack_sec` add another column with suffix "_log" (i.e. `time_to_crack_sec_log` and `offline_crack_log`), holding the log of that quantity (use `across()`!):

```{r}
# passwords <- passwords %>%
#   mutate(### YOUR CODE HERE ###)
```

Just so you won't get too bored, run this chunk to see the scatterplot of `time_to_crack_sec_log` by `strength`:

```{r}
passwords %>%
  count(strength, time_to_crack_sec_log) %>%
  ggplot(aes(strength, time_to_crack_sec_log)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = n), color = "red") +
  theme_bw()
```

Same, but with popularity `rank`:

```{r}
ggplot(passwords, aes(strength, rank)) +
  geom_point(color = "red") +
  theme_bw()
```

(What do you think is that very popular password (low `rank`) and very high `strength`? Do you agree with `strength` in this case?)

And here is the distribution of `time_to_crack_sec_log` by `category`:

```{r}
ggplot(passwords, aes(category, time_to_crack_sec_log)) +
  geom_boxplot(color = "red") +
  labs(x = NULL) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

### Dealing with NAs

##### (10 points)

Put a filtered version of the `passwords` dataset without `NA` values in `passwords_no_na`. Use the `drop_na()` function within a pipe:

```{r}
# passwords_no_na <- ### YOUR CODE HERE ###
```

If you read carefully the columns definition in the [Tidy Tuesday repo](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-01-14), you might have noticed that `strength` should cap at 10, whereas it clearly does not:

```{r}
passwords %>%
  arrange(-strength) %>%
  select(rank, password, strength) %>%
  slice(1:10)
```

Let's assume we're bothered by that and would like to replace all values of `strength` above 10 with `NA`. Use the `replace` function in a pipe, taking inspiration from [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/27909037/4095235) StackOverflow answer:

```{r}
# passwords < passwords %>%
#   mutate(### YOUR CODE HERE ###)
```

See that it worked by filtering only passwords with `NA` for `strength`, do this in a pipe (no starter code, I want you to be able to Google stuff you don't know):

```{r}
### YOUR CODE HERE ###
```

Now let's assume we regret this, but now deleted `strength` values are lost, and so we put the maximum value we know, 10, to all passwords for which we don't know what `strength` is. Use the [`replace_na()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/replace_na.html) function from the `tidyr` package:

```{r}
# passwords <- passwords %>%
#   replace_na(### YOUR CODE HERE ###)
```


### Writing functions

##### (10 points)

Remember when we checked the mean strength for "food" passwords?

Write a function which returns (in a `tibble`) for a given `categ` its mean `rank`, mean `strength` and mean `time_to_crack_sec_log`, ignoring `NA` values:

```{r}
# category_mean_strength <- function(categ) {
#   passwords %>%
#     ### YOUR CODE HERE (can be more than 1 line) ###
#     mutate(categ = categ) %>%
#     select(categ, everything())
# }
#
## Usage
# category_mean_strength("fluffy")
```

Write a "tidy" function which accepts one of the numerical variables (unquoted) name and returns its *median* for every category, ignoring `NA` values. No need to check input:

(Remember the `count_var_for_gender` from class)

```{r}
# median_per_category <- function(numeric_var) {
#   ### YOUR CODE HERE (can be more than 1 line) ###
# }
# 
# # Usage
# median_per_category(strength)
```

### Paper questions

##### (10 points)

Read Section 4.3 of Hadley Wickham's [Tidy Data](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10) 2014 paper (of course you're invited to read the whole thing!).

Let's see exactly what Wickham is talking about. Run this simple `lm` linear model:

```{r}
x1 <- rnorm(100)
x2 <- rnorm(100)
y <- x1 + x2 + rnorm(100, sd = 0.1)

lm_obj <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2)
```

Now, without loading any additional packages, extract by code the p-value for `x2` from the linear model:

```{r}
### YOUR CODE HERE ###
```

Dreadful! Now Wickham says:

> This knocks you out of the flow of analysis and makes it harder to combine the results from multiple models. I’m not currently aware of any packages that resolve this problem.

But things have changed! Google "tidy lm output" and show how to extract that p-value **tidily** (now you can use additional libraries):

```{r}
### YOUR CODE HERE ###
```

### Wrap up

And that's it, you have shown you can wrangle data in the Tidyverse, in a concise, consistent and extensible manner. You also know which passwords not to use. Good luck with the rest of the course!
